# NUMBERING

CA numbering is based on UniProt cluster size

Load numbering is based on UniRef90 cluster size, i.e. node cluster number

For example, IP95, cluster 2-4-3 AS-100, cluster 5 uses CA cluster 6, CR cluster 6, because UniRef90 cluster 6 > cluster 5

        CR:         cluster 6
        CA:         cluster 6
        LOAD:       cluster 5
            IDs:    CA cluster 6
            SSN:    UP cluster 6, UR cluster 5
            CONV:   CR cluster 6
